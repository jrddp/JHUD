# JHUD

This mod is a work in progress.

## Goals

### Versatility

- Allow for a variety of HUD items under multiple circumstances (in inventory, enchanting, etc. Not just the typical in-game overlay)

### Customizability

- Allow user customization to the fullest extent, including attributes for each HUD item
- Allow for easy reading and writing of configurations so that they can be shared between users

### Expandability

- Create easy and universal framework for the addition of new modules through plugins/other mods
